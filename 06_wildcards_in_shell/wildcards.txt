->  A wildcard is a character or a string used to match file and directories.
->  We can use wildcards to create search patterns that when expanded will return a list of matching files and directories.
->  Sometimes wildcards are referred as globs or glob patterns, because globbing is the act of expanding a wildcards into the list os matching files and directories.
->  Wild cards can be used in conjunction with most linux commands is a command accepts a file or directory as an argument then we can use a wildcard in this argument to specy a set of files.
->  Mostly Wildcards are used with 
    - ls
    - rm
    - cp 

***Two main wildcards***
________________________ 

1) *
2) ?

* -: matches zero or more characters. 
    eg: *.txt, a*, a*.txt
? -: matches exactly one character.
    eg: ?.txt, a?, a?.txt

other wildcard
--------------
[] - A character class:
Matches any of the characters inclded between the brackets. Matches exactly one character.
    eg: [aeiou], 
        ca[nt]* => can, cat, candy, catch

we can used this to create very specific search patterns, start with square bracket then list one or more characters we want to match and then end with the right bracket.

[!] - exclude characters using match wildcard:
[!] Matches any of the characters NOT included between the brackets. Matches exactly one character.
eg: [!aeiou]* => baseball, cricket

[_-_] - Range Match wildcard
Use two characters separated by a hyphen to create a range in a character class.
[a-g]*
    - Matches all files that start with a,b,c,d,e,f,g.
[3-6]*
    - Matches all files that start with 3,4,5 or 6.

[[::]] - Named character classes
Instead of using own ranges we can use predefined named character classes
[[:alpha:]]
[[:alnum:]]
[[:digit:]]
[[:lower:]]
[[:space:]]
[[:upper:]]
these named character classes represent the most commonly used ranges
alpha matches alphabetic letters both upper and lower case letters
alnum matches alphanumeric letters this means it matches alpha and digits
digit represents digits from 0-9
Space matches spaces like tabs and new lines as well

how to match wildcard characters?
we need to use escape character(\) if we want to use or match a wild card character
to matches all files ending with question mark
*\?
    done?
If you want to make like easier don't name your file with ? or *.
