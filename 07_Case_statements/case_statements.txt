Learn when to use the case statement and how to do it.
- If we have to use an if statement to compare the same variable against different values you will use a case statement in its place.
- For these situations case statements is easier to read.
-  common use of case statement is in system startup scripts for example 

#!/bin/bash
case "$VAR" in
    pattern_1)
        # Commands go here.
        ;;
    pattern_N)
        # Commands go here.
        ;;

case statements are case sensitive , we can modify script to avoid human errors like misplacing uppercase and lower case alphabets usind WILDCARDS
All the rules for wild cards are eligible and it is in play for the pattern matching section of the case statement.
Lets build a script which accepts input from user and use character class wildcard to avoid human error from their input.

#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter y ot n: " ANSWER
case "ANSWER" in
    [yY]|[yY][eE][sS])
        echo "You have answered yes."
        ;;
    [nN]|[nN][oO])
        echo "You answered no."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid Answer"
        ;;
esac
